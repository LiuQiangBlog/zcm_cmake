# RRR (Bendes): A couple things:
##              1) Lockfree isn't licensed in the original repo
##              2) Is it allowed to license a subdirectory of a licensed repo?
##              3) Since it's the same license, can't we just omit the license in this subdir?
##              4) Should we add lockfree and `transport_ipcshm` to `third_party` if you're worried about licensing? I kinda wanna keep zcm clean of other licensed code in the same repo
